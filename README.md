Deadlock Avoidance & Visualization

This project demonstrates Deadlock Avoidance in Operating Systems using the Banker’s Algorithm.
It visually shows how resources are allocated to processes and how the system avoids entering a deadlock state.

🚀 Features

    Interactive visualization of process and resource allocation
    Implements Banker’s Algorithm for deadlock avoidance
    Displays safe sequences and highlights deadlock conditions
    Simple and clean interface for easy understanding

🧩 Technologies Used

    HTML5 – Structure and layout
    CSS3 – Styling and animations
    JavaScript (ES6+) – Logic and interactivity

⚙️ How to Run
    # Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Deadlock-Avoidence-Visualizer.git
    
    # Open the project folder
    cd BankersAlgorithm-Visualizer
    
    # Run the project
    Open index.html in your browser

📸 Visualization

    Shows processes, resources, and allocation dynamically
    Highlights safe and unsafe states in real time
