Deadlock Avoidance & Visualization

This project demonstrates Deadlock Avoidance in Operating Systems using the Banker’s Algorithm.
It visually shows how resources are allocated to processes and how the system avoids entering a deadlock state.

🚀 Features

Interactive visualization of process and resource allocation
Implements Safe State’s Algorithm for deadlock avoidance
Displays safe sequences and highlights deadlock conditions
Simple and clean interface for easy understanding

🧩 Technologies Used

   HTML5 – Structure and layout
   CSS3 – Styling and animations
   JavaScript (ES6+) – Logic and interactivity
